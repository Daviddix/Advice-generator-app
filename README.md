## Overview
This is a simple advice generator app that generates random advice gotten from the Advice slip API.
The app fetches the advice data from the API and inputs it in the HTML.
The web app was made with simple web dev languages; HTML, CSS and vanilla javaScript.
The design and assets were gotten from a challenge given by frontendmentor

### The challenge

Users should be able to:


Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

## My process
I started with building the skeleton of the app with HTML only and I added CSS for styling the app. I added functionality with javaScript; fetching data from the API, inputting data into the HTML, selectors and so on. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javaScript
